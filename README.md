# UI Coding Question

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3. The CSS framework used was Bootstrap. Styling was not as much of a focus with this app, but rather I wanted to present an understanding of services and observables using rxjs.

## Install dependencies

Once the project has been cloned, run `npm install` to install all dependencies required for the application.

## Run the server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in a browser.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). I provided provided changes to the unit tests to ensure all component generated tests run successfully, along with unit testing some of the functions.
